1. **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI where algorithms learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. This includes supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: This allows machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications include language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.

3. **Computer Vision**: This enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual input, such as images and videos. Applications range from facial recognition to medical imaging diagnostics.

4. **Robotics**: AI is used to create autonomous robots that can perform tasks in real-world environments, from industrial robots to personal assistants.

5. **Expert Systems**: These are AI programs that mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in specific fields, such as medical diagnosis or financial planning.

6. **Neural Networks**: These are computational models inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems. Deep learning, a type of neural network, has been particularly successful in areas like speech and image recognition.
